Problem Statement:
Build a Refrigerator using object-oriented programming principles. 
Only need to implement two methods, put() and get(). 
Put will allow you to put objects into the refrigerator, get() will allow you to get it back. 
Refrigerator may have a different type of shelves, for simplicity, 
assume there are three sizes SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE type of shelves, but many of them.
